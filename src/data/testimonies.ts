        testimony: "God had just became the anchor of my life, allowing me to realize just how loved I am after completing SOCL in 2024, despite the struggles I faced. He had saved me from drowning in my sorrows and fears and pulled me out of the crowd to speak to me. \"Joel, trust in Him.\" This was a recurring theme that I kept receiving and often I broke down in tears asking, \"How Lord? How do I trust in you? Why did you have to die on the cross for me? Why me?\" Through the many rejections and avoidances of people who wanted to reach out to me over the past year, I had finally come to realize how important community was, when I took the leap of faith to be genuine and honest about my sharing.\nI struggled for years, feeling alone and lost. During my A-level year, COVID had changed my daily life. From being used to studying in school, I was now studying at home. It was such a drastic change with everything being online. And if that wasn't enough, my parents argued a lot, separated, and divorced. I just knew I had to focus on my studies and get into uni. I lost contact with my dad and years passed, trying to bury this feeling of emptiness within me.\nWhile I just desired to get good grades and find a good job in uni, God came to me in ways I could never have imagined. He opened my eyes to the truth that I needed Him. Trusting in Him gave me the strength to heal my wounds and while I still struggled this past semester with wanting to do well, He again reminded me that I am his beloved child.\nI like to collect the truth slips that are given out by the Outreach ministry before campus masses. I would keep them away, and only open one up if I was about to study for a test or an exam the next day. I recall it was a Saturday and I had a big test coming on Monday. I only had one truth slip left and thus I thought it would be better to save it for Sunday. So I studied that Saturday without praying a verse, and during my study session, I received a message from someone, with the verse \"Seek ye first the kingdom of God and his righteousness, and all these things will be added to you.\" Matthew 6:33.\nI felt it was very appropriate and it was a reminder to not let my grades control me. The next morning, right before I started my study session, I took out the truth slip. I opened it, and it was the same verse the person had sent me one day earlier! God really sent me a message. He wanted me to know that I wasn't forgotten, and to re-center my life on Him.\nThrough these miraculous and wonderful experiences happening over the past year, I felt it was time for me to share what I had experienced and thus I signed up to be a CGL for CUR. I was very anxious, worried, and really scared that I would not be able to say the right words. However, with the encouragement of community, I told God, \"Jesus, I trust you.\" God really blessed me with the confidence and courage and such a loving CG as well. Praise God for softening my heart, for healing my wounds, and for giving me the assurance that His plans are perfect.\nBrothers and sisters, God calls you out of the crowd, will you take the step and trust Him?\n",
